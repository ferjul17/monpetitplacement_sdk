# MonPetitPlacement SDK

MonPetitPlacement is a French company that offers a financial investment service.  
I'm not part of this company, I'm just one of their customer.

This library is intended to provide you with an easy way to retrieve your data from MonPetitPlacement.  
It uses private API which may change and break this library at any moment.
